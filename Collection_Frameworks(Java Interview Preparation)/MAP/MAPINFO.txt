//In Map the data store in key values pair

Key        values
US-------->United States
BR-------->Brazil

In map the key have unique key for different data

In development the hashmap and treemap are used more and linkedhashmap is simlar to hashmap but the linkedhashmap will link the address of the next data 
To add the data in map we use put() method

In treemap the data will settle based on key basis
